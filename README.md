# SimpleAI

SimpleAI is an open-source project designed to help beginners train and work with AI models easily. It provides tools for preprocessing data, training models, evaluating their performance, and explaining their predictions.

## Features
1. Prebuilt Datasets:
   - Iris dataset for classification.
   - California Housing dataset for regression.

2. AI Model Training:
   - Train classification and regression models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests).

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Measure accuracy, R2 score, and other metrics.

4. Explainable AI:
   - View feature importance and coefficients to understand model predictions.

5. Model Deployment:
   - Deploy trained models as REST APIs using Flask.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Set up a virtual environment:
3. Install dependencies:

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
python main.py


2. Follow the menu to:
- Preprocess datasets.
- Train and evaluate models.
- Load prebuilt datasets.
- Explain model predictions.
